## Problem
Conducting a safe election is a very hectic but important task. Many problems arise during an election such as 
- Fake voting
- Lack of transparency
- Accusations of EVM hacking
- Delay period for vote counting
- Authentication of voters, i.e., the problem of voter ID

## Solution
Blockchain is the solution for many of the above problems.
- Each voter will be registered on the blockchain using biometric ID and can give vote after biometric verification
- Voters can cast only one vote(As the voter will be registered, they will recieve an token or key that will allow them to vote exactly once, i.e., the double spending mechanism but now with voting)
-  This process is safe as well as transparent since voting results will also be live so the voters will be sure that his vote goes to the candidate of his choice. Thus no delay period as well.
- Smart Contract (solidity) will be used for keeping the votes count
- Azure Blockchain workbench will be used for deploying the smart contract
